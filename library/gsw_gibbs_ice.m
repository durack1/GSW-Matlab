% gsw_gibbs_ice                     Gibbs energy of ice and its derivatives
% =========================================================================
%
% USAGE:
%  gibbs_ice = gsw_gibbs_ice(nt,np,t,p)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%  Ice specific Gibbs energy and derivatives up to order 2.
%
% INPUT:
%  nt  =  order of t derivative                      [ integers 0, 1 or 2 ]
%  np  =  order of p derivative                      [ integers 0, 1 or 2 ]
%  t   =  in-situ temperature (ITS-90)                            [ deg C ]
%  p   =  sea pressure                                             [ dbar ]
%   
% OUTPUT:
%  gibbs_ice = Specific Gibbs energy of ice or its derivatives.
%            The Gibbs energy (when nt = np = 0) has units of:     [ J/kg ]
%            The temperature derivatives are output in units of: 
%                                                      [ (J/kg) (K)^(-nt) ]
%            The pressure derivatives are output in units of:
%                                                     [ (J/kg) (Pa)^(-np) ]
%            The mixed derivatives are output in units of:
%                                           [ (J/kg) (K)^(-nt) (Pa)^(-np) ]
%  Note. The derivatives are taken with respect to pressure in Pa, not
%    withstanding that the pressure input into this routine is in dbar.
