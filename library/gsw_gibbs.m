%==========================================================================
%
% USAGE:
%   gibbs = gsw_gibbs(ns,nt,np,SA,t,p)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%  Calculates specific Gibbs energy and its derivatives up to order 3 for
%  seawater.  The Gibbs function for seawater is that of TEOS-10
%  (IOC et al., 2010), being the sum of IAPWS-08 for the saline part and
%  IAPWS-09 for the pure water part.  These IAPWS releases are the
%  officially blessed IAPWS descriptions of Feistel (2008) and the pure
%  water part of Feistel (2003).  Absolute Salinity, SA, in all of the GSW
%  routines is expressed on the Reference-Composition Salinity Scale of
%  2008 (RCSS-08) of Millero et al. (2008).
%
% INPUT:
%  ns  =  order of SA derivative                     [ integers 0, 1 or 2 ]
%  nt  =  order of t derivative                      [ integers 0, 1 or 2 ]
%  np  =  order of p derivative                      [ integers 0, 1 or 2 ]
%  SA  =  Absolute Salinity                                        [ g/kg ]
%  t   =  in-situ temperature (ITS-90)                            [ deg C ]
%  p   =  sea pressure                                             [ dbar ]
%         (ie. absolute pressure - 10.1325 dbar)
%
%  SA, t and p need to have the same dimensions.
%
% OUTPUT:
%  gibbs  =  Specific Gibbs energy or its derivatives.
%
%            The Gibbs energy (when ns = nt = np = 0) has units of:
%                                                                  [ J/kg ]
%            The Absolute Salinity derivatives are output in units of:
%                                                   [ (J/kg) (g/kg)^(-ns) ]
%            The temperature derivatives are output in units of:
%                                                      [ (J/kg) (K)^(-nt) ]
%            The pressure derivatives are output in units of:
%                                                     [ (J/kg) (Pa)^(-np) ]
%            The mixed derivatives are output in units of:
%                              [ (J/kg) (g/kg)^(-ns) (K)^(-nt) (Pa)^(-np) ]
%  Note. The derivatives are taken with respect to pressure in Pa, not
%    withstanding that the pressure input into this routine is in dbar.
